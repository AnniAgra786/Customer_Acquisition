# Objective 
This project focuses on customer acquisition in the EdTech industry, using Python Pandas for data preparation and Tableau for dashboarding. The goal is to analyze and visualize data related to customer acquisition in order to gain insights and make data-driven decisions.
# Project Overview
The project involves the following steps:
## Data Collection: 
Gather relevant data related to customer acquisition in the EdTech industry. This may include information about leads, conversions, marketing campaigns, website traffic, user demographics, etc.

## Data Preparation: 
Use Python Pandas to clean, transform, and preprocess the data. This step involves handling missing values, data normalization, merging multiple datasets if necessary, and any other necessary data transformations.

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): 
Perform exploratory data analysis using Pandas to gain insights into the data. Explore patterns, trends, and relationships within the data to identify key factors influencing customer acquisition.

## Feature Engineering: 
Create new features based on the EDA findings. Calculate metrics such as conversion rates, customer lifetime value, or customer acquisition cost to provide additional insights into the analysis.

## Dashboard Creation:
Utilize Tableau to create interactive and informative dashboards. Visualize key metrics, trends, and patterns related to customer acquisition in the EdTech industry. Use various visualization techniques such as bar charts, line graphs, maps, and filters to present the data effectively.

# Dashboard Summary

## Key Insights from Customer Acquisition Dashboard

## 1 Lead Accommodation: 
The majority of leads are sourced from social media, while the website generates the fewest leads. This suggests that there may be issues with the user-friendliness of the website, which could be hindering lead generation.
## 2.Product Demo Reach:
The product demo video is predominantly watched by people in Mumbai, while the viewership in Hyderabad is minimal. This indicates a possible language barrier or the need to improve the effectiveness of the demo video in addressing the specific requirements of individuals from Hyderabad.

## 3.Language 
Diversity in Demo: The demo video is primarily in English, which might limit its reach to a pan-India audience. To cater to a wider audience, it is crucial to enhance the audio quality of the demo in languages such as Tamil and Hindi.

## 4.Lead Call Success Rate: 
Out of all the calls made to leads, 85.13% were successful, while 14.87% were unsuccessful. This metric indicates a relatively high conversion rate from leads to successful engagements.

## 5. Targeting Other Professional Degrees:
A significant number of leads pursuing a B.Tech degree suggests that the courses offered primarily cater to the tech industry. To expand the customer base, it is worth considering diversifying course offerings to attract professionals from other fields as well.

## 6.Parent's Profession: 
The majority of leads have parents engaged in business. This suggests that the current courses may have a strong emphasis on business-oriented subjects, potentially limiting accessibility to individuals from different socioeconomic backgrounds.

## 7.Team Performance: 
The team with the code SNR501MG, comprising senior managers, stands out as the best-performing team. However, it is essential to investigate the factors contributing to the success of this team and determine how other teams can improve their performance.

## 8. Conversion Rate: 
Out of a total of 1547 leads, only 64 leads successfully converted. This highlights the need to optimize the lead conversion process and identify areas for improvement to increase the conversion rate.

##  9.Age Criteria:
The majority of leads fall into the 18-year-old age group. Understanding the significance of this age criteria will help determine if it aligns with the target audience and if adjustments are needed to target other age groups effectively.

## Manager's Dashboard Insights

1.SNR501MG excels thanks to teamwork and leadership. Concerns with other teams may stem from teamwork, communication, or leadership issues, impacting overall performance.

2. Junior Manager Conversion Rates: JNR1016MG excels, while others face challenges. Potential reasons include training gaps, resource limitations, motivation disparities, team dynamics, and market variations. Addressing these factors can enhance overall performance among junior managers.

3. The continuous decrease in follow-up calls after missed demo appointments may be due to several factors. Prospects may perceive excessive calls as intrusive, prompting a decline in responsiveness. Effective follow-up strategies should balance persistence with respect for prospects' preferences to optimize engagement and conversion rates.
